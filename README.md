In order to use the script, you should have Python (made on 3.13.2), the pytubefix library installed, and ffmpeg source in the directory.
- You can download ffmpeg from: https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html, and simply extract the files to the program directory.


I highly recommend download the program from the build releases.
- If you don't have pytubefix installed, you will find a .bat file in the directory that will install it automatically.

It's simple to use, just execute src.py and enter the video url on the console. All videos downloaded will be on the output folder.
