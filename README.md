In order to use the script, you should have Python (made on 3.13.2) and pytubefix installed and ffmpeg source on the directory.
- You can download ffmpeg on: https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html, and just extract the files on the program directory.
- If you don't have pytubefix installed, in the directory you will find a .bat file that will install it automatically.

Just you can download the release to have everything ready (except for Python but just get it on python.org).

It's simple to use, just execute src.py and enter the video url on the console. All videos downloaded will be on the output folder.
